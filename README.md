## Why This Repo Exists

This repo started as a simple way to track a Star Wars watch-through with my kids.

We wanted to work through the saga in chronological order, keep our place, and use the checklist as a practical way to teach basic Git habits like editing a file, making a commit, and building progress over time.

If you found this repo because you were searching for a **Star Wars viewing order**, **chronological Star Wars watch order**, or a **Star Wars release order tracker**, that is exactly what this project is designed to help with.

## Our Family Progress Tracker

This is the checklist we actually update as we watch. The reference sections below stay untracked on purpose so they remain easy to compare against official guidance.

Optional canon side content not included in the core order above:

## Expanded Chronological Guide

This is the broader **collector-style chronological Star Wars viewing order**. It uses the canon timeline as the spine, then adds Lego, legacy, and bonus entries where they fit best for a fun family watch-through.

| 3 | Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones | Canon |
| 4 | Star Wars: The Clone Wars movie and series | Canon |
| 5 | Tales of the Jedi | Canon anthology |
| 6 | Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith | Canon |
| 7 | Tales of the Empire | Canon anthology |
| 8 | Tales of the Underworld | Canon anthology |
| 9 | Star Wars: The Bad Batch | Canon |
| 10 | Solo: A Star Wars Story | Canon |

| 24 | Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi | Canon |
| 25 | Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker | Canon |

### Suggested Bonus Placements

These are not official canon chronology placements. They are included because they make the watch-through more fun and more complete for kids, collectors, and franchise completists.

| Suggested spot | Title | Type | Placement note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| After Episode II | Lego Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles | Lego | Fun prequel-era companion |
| After Episode II | Lego Star Wars: The Padawan Menace | Lego | Fits well as a light prequel-era extra |
| Before Episode IV | Star Wars: Droids | Legacy | Pre-original-trilogy legacy placement |
| After Episode IV | Star Wars Holiday Special | Legacy | Best treated as an original-trilogy curiosity |
| After Episode IV | Lego Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Out | Lego | Works as a playful post-ANH extra |
| After Episode VI | Lego Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures | Lego | Sits comfortably around the post-OT period |
| After Episode VI | Lego Star Wars: Droid Tales | Lego | Best treated as a saga recap bonus |
| After Episode VI | Ewoks | Legacy | Practical legacy placement rather than strict canon timing |
| Before Episode VII | Lego Star Wars: The Resistance Rises | Lego | Useful lead-in to the sequel era |
| Around the sequel era | Star Wars: Forces of Destiny | Bonus anthology | Spans several eras, so placement is flexible |

## Accuracy Notes

- The canon chronology in this README was checked against the official StarWars.com guide published on May 4, 2025.
- `The Rise of Skywalker` belongs in **2019** for release order.
- `The Bad Batch` released before `The Book of Boba Fett` in 2021, so it appears first in release order here.
- `Tales of the Jedi`, `Tales of the Empire`, `Tales of the Underworld`, and `Forces of Destiny` all span multiple time periods, so any single linear placement is a practical approximation.
- `Star Wars: Resistance` starts before `The Force Awakens` and continues through that era, so it is listed near the sequel transition rather than treated as a perfectly self-contained prequel.
- Lego and legacy entries are intentionally labeled as suggested bonus placements rather than official chronology.
